# Title: Cavai Support Team Onboarding Guide

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Cavai Support Team! This guide will provide you with an overview of the steps we take at Cavai to solve support issues, particularly focusing on troubleshooting JavaScript (JS) tag issues. We will use real-life examples to illustrate the process, helping you gain a clear understanding of how we address and resolve problems.

## Step 1: Understand the issue
The first step in solving any support issue is to understand the problem. This involves reading the description provided by the user, and sometimes asking clarifying questions to gather more information.

**Example Issue:**
"We received a live preview from publisher where our tag, wrapped in Adform tag, is not displaying."

## Step 2: Review relevant details
Carefully examine the provided details, such as:

- Deadline
- Affected campaigns
- Affected countries
- Creatives involved
- Key stakeholders

## Step 3: Investigate the problem
After understanding the issue, start investigating the problem. This may involve:

- Testing the user's creative(s) or tag(s)
- Checking for compatibility with different DSPs (e.g., Adform, Yahoo, Amazon)
- Identifying potential errors in the implementation

### Understanding JavaScript and common errors
JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for web development to add interactivity and functionality to websites. Common typos and errors include:

- Misspelled or undeclared variables
- Missing or mismatched braces, brackets, or parentheses
- Incorrect use of operators or assignment
- Syntax errors

For JS tag issues, pay special attention to:

- Errors in the browser console
- Incorrect tag implementation
- Conflicts with other scripts on the page
- Network or server issues

### Common console log errors and their meanings
When troubleshooting JavaScript, it's important to look at the browser console for error messages. Some common console log errors include:

- `ReferenceError`: Indicates an undeclared variable or function
- `TypeError`: Occurs when a value is not of the expected type
- `SyntaxError`: Indicates a problem with the script's syntax, such as a missing brace

### Testing tags
There are various platforms where you can test tags, including:

- [test-a-tag.com](http://www.test-a-tag.com/): An online platform for testing ad tags
- Localhost: You can also test tags locally by creating a simple HTML file and embedding the tag code

## Step 4: Communicate and collaborate with the team
Leverage the expertise of your teammates while keeping the user informed throughout the process. This may involve discussing the issue in a group setting, assigning specific tasks to individual team members, or providing progress updates to the user.

## Step 5: Develop a solution
Once the root cause is identified, work on developing a solution. This may involve implementing new features, fixing bugs, or suggesting alternative approaches.

For JS tag issues, some common solutions may include:

- Correcting errors in the tag implementation
- Modifying the tag to ensure compatibility with the publisher's site
- Resolving conflicts with other scripts on the page
- Addressing network or server issues

### CSS vs JS issues
It's important to differentiate between CSS and JS issues:

- CSS issues: Problems related to the visual appearance, layout, or styling of elements on the page
- JS issues: Problems related to the functionality, interactivity, or logic of the web page

## Step 6: Test the solution
Before implementing the solution, test it thoroughly to ensure it addresses the issue and doesn't introduce new problems.

## Step 7: Implement and close the issue
After successfully testing the solution, implement it and inform the user about the resolution. Close the issue once it has been confirmed as resolved.

## Step 8: Document the resolution
Finally, document the issue, its resolution, and any important learnings for future reference. This helps improve the knowledge base and streamlines the process of solving similar issues in the future.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you'll be well-equipped to handle support issues at Cavai. Remember that collaboration and communication are key, as they ensure you can leverage the expertise of the entire team to provide the best possible solutions to our users. Stay up-to-date with the latest developments in JavaScript, as well as any changes to the Cavai platform, to ensure you're always prepared to tackle any issue that arises. Good luck, and welcome to the Cavai Support Team!
