Title: Cavai Support Team Onboarding Guide

Introduction:
Welcome to the Cavai Support Team! This guide will provide you with an overview of the steps we take at Cavai to solve support issues. We will use real-life examples to illustrate the process, helping you gain a clear understanding of how we address and resolve problems.

Step 1: Understand the issue
The first step in solving any support issue is to understand the problem. This involves reading the description provided by the user, and sometimes asking clarifying questions to gather more information. Here's an example:

Example Issue:
"VPAID Click Macro does not work in overlay"

Step 2: Review relevant details
Carefully examine the provided details, such as:

- Deadline
- Affected campaigns
- Affected countries
- Creatives involved
- Key stakeholders

Step 3: Investigate the problem
After understanding the issue, start investigating the problem. This may involve:

- Testing the user's creative(s) or tag(s)
- Checking for compatibility with different DSPs (e.g., Adform, Yahoo, Amazon)
- Identifying potential errors in the implementation

Step 4: Collaborate with the team
Leverage the expertise of your teammates. This may involve discussing the issue in a group setting or assigning specific tasks to individual team members. For instance, in the example provided, team members suggested various solutions, such as:

- Trying AdForm click macro in the tag before uploading to Flashtalking
- Using the postMessage workaround
- Focusing on MyCavai and the new engine

Step 5: Communicate with the user
Keep the user updated throughout the process. Provide them with progress updates, ask for additional information if needed, and share your findings. For example, the support team in the provided scenario shared their test results and previews with the user.

Step 6: Develop a solution
Once the root cause is identified, work on developing a solution. This may involve implementing new features, fixing bugs, or suggesting alternative approaches. In the example, the team proposed focusing on MyCavai and the new engine, adding support for detecting VPAID containers, and defining cases for firing the 'AdClickThru' event.

Step 7: Test the solution
Before implementing the solution, test it thoroughly to ensure it addresses the issue and doesn't introduce new problems.

Step 8: Implement and close the issue
After successfully testing the solution, implement it and inform the user about the resolution. Close the issue once it's resolved and the user is satisfied.

Conclusion:
Solving support issues at Cavai involves a collaborative and systematic approach. By following these steps, you will be able to address and resolve problems effectively and efficiently, ensuring our users have the best experience possible. Welcome to the team, and we look forward to working with you!
