# Title: Cavai Support Team Onboarding Guide

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Cavai Support Team! This guide will provide you with an overview of the steps we take at Cavai to solve support issues, particularly focusing on troubleshooting JavaScript (JS) tag issues. We will use real-life examples to illustrate the process, helping you gain a clear understanding of how we address and resolve problems.

## Step 1: Understand the issue
The first step in solving any support issue is to understand the problem. This involves reading the description provided by the user, and sometimes asking clarifying questions to gather more information.

**Example Issue:**
"We received a live preview from publisher where our tag, wrapped in Adform tag, is not displaying."

## Step 2: Review relevant details
Carefully examine the provided details, such as:

- Deadline
- Affected campaigns
- Affected countries
- Creatives involved
- Key stakeholders

## Step 3: Investigate the problem
After understanding the issue, start investigating the problem. This may involve:

- Testing the user's creative(s) or tag(s)
- Checking for compatibility with different DSPs (e.g., Adform, Yahoo, Amazon)
- Identifying potential errors in the implementation

For JS tag issues, pay special attention to:

- Errors in the browser console
- Incorrect tag implementation
- Conflicts with other scripts on the page
- Network or server issues

## Step 4: Collaborate with the team
Leverage the expertise of your teammates. This may involve discussing the issue in a group setting or assigning specific tasks to individual team members.

## Step 5: Communicate with the user
Keep the user updated throughout the process. Provide them with progress updates, ask for additional information if needed, and share your findings.

## Step 6: Develop a solution
Once the root cause is identified, work on developing a solution. This may involve implementing new features, fixing bugs, or suggesting alternative approaches.

For JS tag issues, some common solutions may include:

- Correcting errors in the tag implementation
- Modifying the tag to ensure compatibility with the publisher's site
- Resolving conflicts with other scripts on the page
- Addressing network or server issues

## Step 7: Test the solution
Before implementing the solution, test it thoroughly to ensure it addresses the issue and doesn't introduce new problems.

## Step 8: Implement and close the issue
After successfully testing the solution, implement it and inform the user about the resolution. Close the issue once it's resolved and the user is satisfied.

Conclusion:
Solving support issues at Cavai involves a collaborative and systematic approach. By following these steps and paying special attention to the unique aspects of troubleshooting JS tag issues, you will be able to address and resolve problems effectively and efficiently, ensuring our users have the best experience possible. Welcome to the team, and we look forward to working with you!
